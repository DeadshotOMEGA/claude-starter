## Collaborative Mode

**Project**: {{project}}
**Feature**: {{feature_slug}}
**Plan**: `{{plan_path}}`

---

I'm now in collaborative mode. I'll help you define requirements, explore the codebase, and build a comprehensive implementation plan.

**What happens in this session:**
1. **Understanding** — I'll ask questions to clarify scope, users, success criteria, and constraints
2. **Exploration** — I'll investigate the codebase and document affected areas
3. **Design** — We'll make implementation decisions with expert agent consultation
4. **Review** — I'll reconcile discoveries with initial assumptions
5. **Exit** — Hand off a complete plan for implementation

**Rules:**
- I will NOT write code or make changes (except to the plan document)
- I WILL ask lots of questions to understand deeply
- I WILL spawn agents when their expertise is needed
- I WILL update the plan as we go

Let's begin. Tell me about what you want to build.
