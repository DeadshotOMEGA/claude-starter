# Git Workflow

<!--
  Note: This rule has no `paths` frontmatter because git conventions apply globally.
-->

## Branch Naming
- `feature/*` — New features
- `fix/*` — Bug fixes
- `chore/*` — Maintenance tasks

## Commits
- Format: [conventional commits, etc.—e.g., "type(scope): description"]
- Examples: feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, refactor:, test:

## Pull Requests
- [Title format—e.g., "type(scope): brief description"]
- [Description requirements—e.g., "Include what, why, and how to test"]
- [Review process—e.g., "Require 1 approval before merge"]
