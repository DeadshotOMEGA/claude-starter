Create a new slash command file with proper structure. Gather requirements from the user, and follow best prompting practices. Save the command to project or user (ask me, unless easy to infer).

Reference guide: @~/.claude/workflows/custom-slash-commands-guide.md

The command should:
- Include descriptive frontmatter
- Use clear argument placeholders if needed
- Follow patterns from the guide
